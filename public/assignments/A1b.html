    Assignment 1B: Neural Implicit Surface
</h1>

<p class="mb-4">
    Welcome to the second part of our exploration of SDF! In this section, you will continue practicing coding with implicit functions, this time incorporating neural networks as your new friend! The main task for this assignment consists of two steps: first, you will construct and train a neural SDF model in Python using a Colab Jupyter Notebook. Then, you will render this model using GLSL in our WebGL shader. You will be working on both aspectsâ€”neural network training and shader-based rendering. Let's get started!

<h2 class="h2-custom">Requirements</h2>
<p class="mb-4">
For this assignment, you are expected to implement two main components to generate a neural SDF and then render it in a GLSL environment with ray marching. We will briefly discuss each component as follows.
</p>

<h3 class="h3-custom">Step 1: Neural SDF Creation</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
In this step, you are asked to create a pytorch Dataset class named <code>NeuralSDFDataset</code> which loads a 3D mesh with <code>.obj</code> format and sample data points for training. After this, you will create a network to train Neural SDF. Finish the training loop and train your network and
tune your network hyperparameters if you have time.
</p>

<h3 class="h4-custom">Step 1.1 Preparation</h3>
<p class="mb-4">    
    Upload our <code>neural_sdf.ipynb</code> to Google Colab following the tutorial given in <code>Tutorials/Google Colab Tutorial</code>. Run all the cells before Step 1.2. These cells will install required packages
    and give helper functions we shall need later to convert network weights to matrices that can be used in our shader to represent the trained network.
</p>

<h3 class="h4-custom">Step 1.2 NeuralSDFDataset</h3>
<p class="mb-4">    
    In this step, you will implement a <code>NeuralSDFDataset</code> class. We will follow the the way Neural SDF paper sample training points where more points are sampled
    near the mesh surface and less points in the space of a unit sphere. This functionality is provided in a package called <code>mesh_to_sdf</code> and we shall take advantage of this.

    You should go to the place where it says Step 1.2 in the comments and perform the following steps.  </br>
    (1) You will first use a package called <code>trimesh</code> (it's already imported in Step 1.1) to load a <code>.obj</code>
    file with path <code>mesh_path</code>.</br>
    </br>
    <!-- (2) You will use our provided <code>normalize_mesh</code> function to normalize the mesh to correct range.</br>
    </br> -->
    (2) After loading this mesh, you will use <code>sample_sdf_near_surface</code> function from <code>mesh_to_sdf</code> package to sample training points 
    for this mesh. You should sample <code>sample_num</code> number of points for training. </br>
    </br>
    (3) After sampling points, you will convert sampled points in type <code>numpy ndarray</code> to <code>torch tensor</code> by using the <code>torch.from_numpy</code> function.
    Since we are using Colab where GPU is available, you will put those tensors to <code>CUDA</code> by using <code>.to(device)</code>.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
    You should see a point cloud like this for bunny and cow.
</p>

    <img src="/assignments/A1b_img/cow.png" alt="Image 2">
</div>


<h3 class="h4-custom">Step 1.3 Network Structure</h3>
<p class="mb-4">    
    After the dataset is finished. You will be tasked to create a Network class called <code>NeuralSDF</code>. This consists of two parts: 1. a helper class for creating
    identical layers called <code>SineLayer</code>, 2. the <code>NeuralSDF</code> Layer. </br>
    </br>
    (1) You should fill in the constructor of <code>SineLayer</code> class. This requires you to first create a Linear layer with input features size <code>in_features</code>
    and output feature size <code>out_features</code>. </br>
    </br>
    (2) You should fill in the <code>forward</code> function. If <code>is_last</code> is True, then you should not apply any activation functions (i.e. sin activation) or skip connections to this layer.
    If <code>is_first</code> is True, then you should apply the sin activation function but not the skip connection. Otherwise, you should apply both sin activation and skip connection. </br>
    For sin activation, it should be in form <code>sin(omega * f(x))</code> where <code>omega</code> being sin activation frequency and <code>f(x)</code> being the output of linear layer. </br>
    For skip connection, it should be in form <code>current_layer(x) / skip_weight + x</code> where <code>x</code> being the input to current layer, <code>current_layer</code> being <code>sin(omega * f(x))</code>
    and <code>skip_weight</code> is given in the class constructor. </br>
    </br>
    (3) After finish the <code>SineLayer</code> class, lets move to finish the last piece of the network structure, i.e. put every together. In <code>NeuralSDF</code>, you should use the 
    <code>SineLayer</code> class to create our network structures. Use <code>is_first=True</code> for the first layer and <code>is_first=False</code> otherwise. Use <code>is_last=True</code> for the last layer and <code>is_last=False</code> otherwise.
    You should create one first layer which has input feature size <code>in_features</code> and output feature size <code>hidden_features</code>. You should then create <code>hidden_layers</code> number of 
    hidden layers with both input and output feature size of <code>hidden_features</code>. Finally, you should create the last layer with input features size <code>hidden_features</code> and output features size being 1. You should use 
    the skip weights being set to <code>skip_weight=sqrt(i+1)</code> where <code>i</code> is the current index of hidden layer.
</p>

<h3 class="h4-custom">Step 1.4 Train Your Network</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    Finally, you will finish the training loop. You will use Mean Squared Loss (MSE) as our loss function. Remember to zero the grad in your optimizer at the start of each iteration and
    propagates the loss backward at the end of each iteration.</br>
    <br>
    Now, train your network! It should be fast which will finish in several minutes. After you finish everything and if you have time, feel free to play with the parameters and network structures.
</p>


<h3 class="h3-custom">Step 2: Copy Network Weights to Shader</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    Run the last cell of your notebook. Be sure to run this after the training loop finishs. Copy the text printed out in your notebook and paste them to <code>sdfBunny</code> for bunny and <code>sdfCow</code> for cow.
    You should now see your trained result on your screen. (Remember to refresh the browser page if you changed your code).
</p>

<h3 class="h3-custom">Step 3: Scene SDF</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
In this step, you are tasked with constructing the scene's SDF using the two neural SDF objects. You will need to position these two objects appropriately according to the instructions in the starter code comment. The final SDF function should return the minimum distance to any neural implicit surface in the scene.
</p>

<h3 class="h3-custom">Step 4: Ray Marching</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
In this step, you are asked to implement the ray marching algorithm to render the SDF scene. You are allowed to reuse your previous implementation in A1a for this function.
</p>

<h3 class="h3-custom">Step 5: Normal Calculation</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
In this step, you will calculate the surface normal at a given point using the finite difference method. You are allowed to reuse your previous implementation in A1a for this function.
</p>

<h3 class="h3-custom">Step 6: Lighting and Coloring</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
In this step, you are asked to color the objects to achieve realistic lighting effects. You are also tasked to assign a unique color to each neural SDF object in the scene based on its position or type. <em>We do not ask for a perfect match of our given video. You may pick any color you like for the rendering of these four objects.</em>

Once you have implemented all these steps, you should be able to observe the two neural SDF models as shown in the video below.

<h2 class="h2-custom">Creative Expression</h2>
In the Creative Expression section of this assignment, you are encouraged to train your customized neural SDF model. You may either use one of the meshes provided in our starter code, or you may download a new mesh and train its neural SDF model in Colab. You may adjust the size of the network (e.g., the number of layers, the number of weights, etc.) to improve the appearance of your neural SDF model. The creative expression theme for this assignment is <strong>A Tangible Network</strong>.
